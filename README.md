THINGS DONE SO FAR:
- sphere creation w/ lighting
- cube creation w/ texture maps
- platform creation (decide: change the texture map or just implement a cube only instead w/ no texture)
- objects falling ( currently just uses a counter to move it down)
- -- objects just reset and start at top to make it continuous - need to change
- platform movement in x and z ( modelspace movement)
- world rotation to move around objects ( rotates world space - may need to modify to move modelspace instead)
- 

THINGS WE NEED TO DO:
- iterations of objects ( if we stack we have to make it have multiple that exist, cant just reset)
- --- maybe a stack (push, pop)
- point counter?
- collision detection
- transparancy?
- how we implement the 3d element (grid or rotation or both or something else?)
