shadedSphere4.html and shadedSphere4.js contain the sun, four planets, and a moon with different colors on a black background. 
All implementations has been sucessfully created for the required portion.



For the extra credit

-A moon was included to orbit around the watery blue planet

-Using the 'c ' key, we can lock on to planet 2 ( green) and sit on top of it. We can rotate around on this planet. The planet is visible underneath so that it is easy to know where we are located.

-Code development was done on my Github before submission to the org.

-The assignment was submitted early.

//Note
-The MV.js file was modified to accept the first scale function, the second was commented out because overloading is prohibited.
